# **App Name**: TwinVision

## Core Features:

- 3D Visualization: Displays a 3D visualization of the manufacturing line.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Monitors machine status and displays real-time data (temperature, load, speed).
- Control Interface: Allows users to send control commands (stop, start, adjust speed).
- Sensor Simulation: Simulates data from virtual sensors using parameters like temperature, load and speed.
- Alert Logging: Offers alert logging functionality.
- Simulation Replay: Ability to replay the simulation to analyze machine behavior.
- Failure Prediction: Generative AI tool: Based on simulation data, predict common failure types. Generates a likely time of failure with confidence score. 

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Steel blue (#4682B4) to evoke precision and industry.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) to provide a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF4500) to highlight critical data and control buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective feel.
- Use clear, technical icons for machine components and status indicators.
- Dashboard layout should prioritize real-time data displays and control interfaces.
- Subtle animations to indicate changes in machine status or data updates.
